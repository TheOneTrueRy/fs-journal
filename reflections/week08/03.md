## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

- The testing of code/components to see if... well if they work lol. You should test things to see if they function correctly! It is a crazy concept. 

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

- Making sure that each little piece and component works properly and functions how it is supposed to makes the larger product in the end function how its supposed to. An actually functioning and properly made product is a good product. Testing modules and components individually also means that multiple of them can be worked on at once by different teams/individuals.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

- Uh... well I don't see a single one listed in the reading but maybe like... someone getting stuck or hung up on a test not working properly or having to write it out or something not working? That's kind of the whole point of this though is to find out if something isn't working and then work at it until it is...
