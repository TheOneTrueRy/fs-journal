## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- Well you want a portfolio website to show to potential employers or whoever could possibly want to hire you so they can actually see your skills.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- The quality of the projects you've made, the quality of the actual site/portfolio you are holding all these projects in, and I'd say having obvious care and thought actually put into the projects you made.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- I would definitely include my Network project, my UNSC Mock Clone (first checkpoint), Moon Miner, and Gratuities.
