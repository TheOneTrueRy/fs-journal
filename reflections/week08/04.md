## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit Testing (the isolated/indivudal testing of specific units of code), Component Testing (testing of components with Vue conveniences integrated), and End to End Testing (the testing of an application as a whole to simulate it as how a user would use it, see if it is all functioning).

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- I like the sound of End to End Testing personally, I like to go through my site entirely as if I was a user or have a user go through and see if there is anything wrong in the bigger picture or obvious error popping when someone tries to do something because I was too tunnel'd in or focused on other things.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- Component Testing was (barely) "explained" in a confusing way and I still don't really get what it is or it's uses, but seems to be like maybe it's specifically a Vue thing? So I'm gonna put that here lol
