## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- It's important for everyone to feel like they are being heard, they're being included, and that they actually know what is going on, how the app works, and how they are contributing. Without proper communication it's easy for anyone to get lost and be too afraid or embarrassed to ask for help or clarification. Constant communication can also cut down on the amount of time spent stuck in meetings or stand-ups wondering what everyone is doing and thinking.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- Honestly mannnn I really couldn't tell you after I read this journal article twice because it is entirely about this writer explaining how to properly communicate in scrum, how to deal with a situation where two workstreams needed to work at the same time, and the unattainable triangle of sprints. I did not see a single thing about the differences between larger scrum teams and smaller scrum teams lmao

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- The three sides of the unattainable triangle are: Good service Cheap won't be Fast; Good service Fast won't be Cheap; Fast service Cheap won't be Good. (I think the tradeoffs of each side are pretty obviously said right there in the "tenants" lol)

- Planning every little detail out when it comes to thinking up and building a brand new full-stack application from scratch STILL takes a lot of time and effort!
