## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

- Separating a piece of code, including HTML, JS, and CDD (at least in vue) into a whole separate file that you can just call on anywhere on any other page and just inject the whole contents of that component where you put it.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

- Making code cleaner, neater, less lines on less pages. Also makes it so you can reuse an element of code/page on multiple different pages.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

- Could cause some problems if you don't understand exactly how to use Components and things that are occasionally necessary for them (such as props).

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
