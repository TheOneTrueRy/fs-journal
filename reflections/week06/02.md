## Questions

1. What are props?

- Props a lil things that we use to pass down variables and js info from a parent component/page to a child component. Kind of like passing down a variable into the argument part of a function :) I think :)

2. What are props used for?

- Making basically an object variable (in the child component) that comes down from the parent component/page that theeee child component can then use for stuff! Like a "post" defined in the parent component as one object in the posts area (also defined in parent component) theeeen I can have a post prop in the child component and access that post object with all its lil dot notation goodies.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

- In the script part of any component? Is that too easy or short of an answer? This seems like a trick...

- Gifted wassss a lot easier both in vue and admittedly... without a partner ðŸ˜… Felt good to finally be back into a feeling of strong confidence and ease when it comes to making these sites and projects, finished it in no time and styled the fuck out of it! Looks so nice ðŸ˜Œ
