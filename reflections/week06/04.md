## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

- I think it's when you make a route in the router that goes to a child page of another page. So like how it had a travel / travels page, which is a route, but then you could go to travels/america for info on America or travels/china for info on China, and thoooose are nested routes? Right? :)

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

- Well I think the stuff like profiles/:profileId we have been using on a few sites would count as a nested route though we have been doing them just by making whole new paths with like a new path: name: and component:, just doing aaaa children: [] type thing. So iiiii don't knowwww maybe I do anyways yeah I'd like for us to use the "children: []" type example at some point in class like was in this journal :)

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

- Oh man idk maybeee like uhhh to go to a certain profile in the profiles with a profileId query param teehee
