## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

- To... mess withhhh the code? To have things happen like js functions or data changes when certain events happen like page load, page creation, page unload, when something is updated on the page, etc. Imma be real with you dawg, this is the most just nonsense journal page I have ever seen yet and is nearly completely filled with words that will just confuse us students considering not a single one of these things is talked about or mentioned in curriculum lmao

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

- We've used things like computed and onMounted or onUnmounted a few times, those have been really good, especially computed and onMounted those are needed just about constantly everywhere :)

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

- Mounting hooks, like the before, mounted, and maybe unmounted like I talked about above are things that are run or done before the page is actually rendered, when its rendered, and when it is un-rendered respectively. We use onMounted pretty frequently to run functions on a page load or change.
