## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

- Base64 is an encoding schema for representing binary data, like images, in a text format. Turns an image into a whole buncha crazy junk lookin text 👍

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

- They're harder to use imo, can cause page loading problems with cpu overhead and caching, and will make the image have a larger filesize than if you had just used a normal image.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

- This question is asked in a nonsense way and doesn't make sense but basically Base64 used to actually help far enough in the past when an image heavy website took a long time to load and needed roundtrips browsers needed for each image and instead B64 could just have em like embedded right in the html and was faster  yadda yadda yadda anyways now our shit is fast and it just hurts in the ways listed above.
