# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Well, our capstone is great and we got a lot done. Hackathon also was actually pretty fun and got to just mess around a lot thankfully.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Well I can't remember any shocks or surprises during the actual week so I'll say that I'm watching Hunger Games: Catching Fire and it was pretty surprising when Plutarch was revealed to be in on everything and came back specifically to make a map that allowed Katniss to get out. That was pretty cool. :)

- What are you struggling with?

The thought of whether or not I really do want to apply for being a TA if there is a position open. I used to be so sure ðŸ˜…

- What would you count as a victory?

Miles taught me how to play a few sweet sounding guitar chords on Josue's guitar during hackathon. Those made me feel pretty happy :)
