## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

- An SSL Certificate is a small data file that "cryptographically" (whatever that means) establishes an encrypted and secure link between the browser and a webpage. This binding between your browser and the webpage by the SSL ensures no one/think but your browser and the webpage can see or access the information you type or submit.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

- EV SSL Certificates are the most expensive to obtain and show off the most legitimacy of a site showing the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country all in the address bar. An OV SSL is the next best thing, offering a medium level of encryption and security, shown off with a green padlock and business name in the address bar. The DV Certificate is the easiest to obtain and the lowest level of encryption and security. It will only take you a few company documents to apply and won't cost you much, and will be shown off with just the green padlock next to your URL.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

- Shows that your site and your business and more legitimate, helps secure both your site's information and the information and safety of all of your users, and your site will actually receive a bit of an upperhand over a non-secure site in the search engine algorithm of (at least) Google.
