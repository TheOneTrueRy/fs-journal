> **ðŸ“– [GitHub Actions and How to Use Them](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk8-9/05-Github-Actions)**

## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

- Github actions are making an automatic process happen through using workflow text files whenever someone does any kind of certain triggering action that you set up. This could be something like making it run a build job to build out your repo into a deployable format anytime someone specifically pushes up to the main branch.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

- They can automate processes to happen whenever someone triggers them. An example would be so you don't have to npm run build every time something changes. (I think :))

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

- Running something upon anyone pushing to the repo, pulling from the repo, apparently it can be done when someone even stars the repo or comments on a request. Make them do whatever you want!
