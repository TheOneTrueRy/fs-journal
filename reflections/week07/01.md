## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

- Pair programming is when two programmers assume the role of "Driver" or "Navigator" both using one workspace/one keyboard to code. The driver is the one typing and coding while explaining it out-loud while the navigator helps them, talks about what they could do to solve problems or achieve something, intervene whenever needed, etc.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

- Better diffusion of skills amongst the team and elevating everyone involved, along with the coding being of a higher quality and skill level considering it's made with coding out-loud and the combined knowledge/skills of two programmers.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

- Potentially increased overhead, and any kind of relationship problems between two people paired up would be very bad for the work/code. Also it could end up being slower if it becomes more of a teacher/student scenario with one programmer being much less experienced or skilled than the other.
