![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- I'm not sure literally the first week we DIDN'T do partner programming on a Thursday is the right time to give us this journal lmao

2. What went well this week?

- The Checkpoint ☺️

3. What would you do differently?

- Well Jeremy had a couple styling/site feedback statements/prompts on my Tower project, so I'll probably think of those to do differently in future assignments
