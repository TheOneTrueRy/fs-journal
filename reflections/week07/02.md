## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

- Code documentation is writing explanations of what changes you've made to code in a README/what the code does in that README, or writing comments in your code to explain functions, or other kinds of explaining documentations that could help outsiders understand your code/project.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

- Making it easier for people other than yourself or your close teammates to understand either your code or what it is your entire project is supposed to do. It also can help other people working on your code or on your project understand how to use functions you've written.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

- Ehhhhhh on a team project? I'd maybe write comments or use Comment Anchors or some such to explain what my code is doing or how to use it or what to work on further in some way, but on a solo project? Probably not unless I'm feeling generous or in the mood lol. A README or outside form of documentation is nice for more of a public side of viewers into your code/project.
