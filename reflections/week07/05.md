# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I got my duck :) 

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

I can come scarily close to NOT getting my duck! I don't think I'll ever forget a .prevent on an @submit again! Christ!

- What are you struggling with?

Laziness, boredom, procrastination, burning desire to play Clone Hero again after Mick forbid us from it like 3 weeks ago

- What would you count as a victory?

Something that actually happened this week that is a victory? Getting my duck. Something I'd love to happen that I would count as a victory? Mick turning the arcade machine back on...
