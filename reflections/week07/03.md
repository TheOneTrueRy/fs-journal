## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

- User Experience, or UX, is the interaction(s) that a user has with your site, app, service, whatever you want to call it. It's them clicking on buttons and it doing something, what that buttons labeled, how can they tell what it does, what is it they are wanting it to do? That kind of thing. The whole goal is to be considering making things in a way that allows the user to do what they want to do on your site/app. That's what you need to consider.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

- Well during testing you're a user of the site so it makes things better for you for starters. Also, who doesn't like it when people enjoy the things they make and give good feedback/reassurances? Thirdly, if this is an app that is used for business or income or anything like that, the better user experience means the better profits/impressions!

3. Why is the User Experience important?

- Everything I just said above! Better User Experience == better user feedback! Better user feedback is then better reviews, better reputation, better profits, better everything!
