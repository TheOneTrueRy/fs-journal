# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

The week was a bit of a struggle at first but got better and easier to understand later, the backend CAN be pretty easy and not that much work (especially compared to the front end) but it should still have attention paid to it and care put into it so I don't fuck everything up and hate myself (perhaps me during hackathon sometimes)

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

The hackathon wasn't as much of a fun, dick-around, "just hangout" LAN party as I was expecting. It was more like just a 15 hour school day lol.

- What are you struggling with?

Not being stressed and tense on weekends when I should just be ENJOYING THEM (and also still remembering journals hehe)

- What would you count as a victory?

Our hackathon project is pretty fuckin good, I wish I did more and I wish it was even better but that's because it's possible the thing I work on will never be good enough in my painfully perfectionist eyes ðŸ˜Š
