## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

- Virtuals are just additional fields onto a model whose values can be set manually or automatically. They only exist *logically* and aren't actually written directly to the document.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

- I don't know man, all the time? During my capstone and during birdbrain and during other times I want to put an object reference inside my model/schema and refer to it later in a .populate probably? It's pretty nice :)

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

- By running a get method on the virtual, returning the virtuals value.
