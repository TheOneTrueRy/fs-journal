## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

- Setting a predetermined time that you will spend doing something before you do it. Including a deadline/limit of how long it will be done or worked on before you move on.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

- It is very unlikely my habit-formed brain will actually adapt and use this method and it's strategies listed, especially being a perfectionist that puts a painful amount of time into things, BUT some things I can imagine sure would be nice to implement and take use of would be things liiiike: The "Swallow the frog" part, using an egg timer or an actual timer on your phone/computer sounds like a good idea, and well being able to "strategically quit" something and actually make myself stop working on something or some indulging in some kind of luxury sure would be nice lol

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?

- I would've liked to have had more fun at the hackathon instead of spending all of our time working on the project and getting it as perfect and great as possible but that's what basically everyone in our cohort did so if I just slacked off and had fun then I would've seemed like a dick :/ I WANTED A FUN LAN PARTY MAN!!!
