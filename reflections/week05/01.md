> **ðŸ“– [Using Query Parameters](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/01-Query-Parameters)**

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

- To search/filter through a database to find a specific item/object or an array of all different objects that fit the criteria you put into the query.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

- Say your URL ends in the usual / right, then after that is a ?, that is the start of a query parameter. To distinguish between parameters you use the & symbol, so one query search would look something like this: www.cups.com/?shippingCost=40&totalCost=95&quadrantCode=9A

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

- Basically all the time lol, being able to filter or search through data in a database/server will always be nice, either for testing of your code/server or just actual data searching/retrieval.
