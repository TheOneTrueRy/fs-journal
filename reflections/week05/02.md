## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

- One to One, One to Many, and Many to Many.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

- Linking looks better to do, can have things be more organized/less messy, and fixes three possible problems that can occur when you try and do embedding on something like a One-To-Many.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

- Establishing the relationship balancing, what type of embedding or linking strategy you should use, the real world context of what it is that you are linking relationships between are all what come to mind.
