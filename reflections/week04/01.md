> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

- A pyramid shape, lots of }), and absolutely hellish to my eyes code are some signs of 'Callback Hell'. This can be caused by someone trying to write JS in a way where all of the code happens (visually) from top to bottom like how other, not-weird coding languages might normally work.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

- Asynchronous basically just means "takes some time" or will happen in the future, and callbacks are used to store some info/a function when doing those things that take time, like downloading things, reading files, talking to APIs, etc.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

- Keep your code shallow, Write small modules that each do one thing and assemble them together, and handle every single error, like all the trycatch's we do :P
