## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

- To make asynchronous functions and make all code (await) until a line is done so it can actually have the data we're trying to use and manipulate.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

- Make the function async and put 'await' before the promise, something such as 'await sandboxApi.get'

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

- Well I kinda NEED EM to work with databases like APIs and do asynchronous coding. That's a pretty big benefit. Maybe I could use some of the other methods talked about in the last couple days of journals but those made absolutely no fuckin sense and weren't taught to me in school so hell no.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- Learned how to tap into deeper layers of API data such as the types and sprites I needed, which required some tough learning and even some bracket notation because PokeAPI used a damn HYPHEN for one of their data names.
