## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

- REST stand for REpresentational State Transfer. This means that when a REST(ful) API is called the server *transfers* (T) to the client a *representation* (RE) of the *state* (S) of the requested resource. The Api when called basically just returns the state of a resource, such as an object.

2. What does Stateless mean?

- Stateless means that the server does not remember anything about the user of the API.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

- HTTP obviously for HTTP requests, and then the url will have to have some kind of database identifier after the end /, such as "https://www.twitter.com/jk_rowling" with jk_rowling being the unique username and resource identifier.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I would say Thomas didn't seem to know what he was doing but I think we were both a couple of sleep-deprived idiots struggling with this assignment lmao (Also the link at the top of this journal goes to The Fetch API page when all the questions are about the What Is Rest page.)
