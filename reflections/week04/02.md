## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- Pending, Resolved, and Rejected. All pretty self-explanatory with the names.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- We attach callbacks to promises rather than passing them and stacking them on top of each other so situations where we use multiple async operations at once look much cleaner and make more sense :)

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

- .then() happens when the promise is resolved and successful, .catch is for if/when a promise is rejected and fails, aka error handling.
