# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I really don't remember, all I remember is NOT sleep that's for sure, and for most the week not much of anything because we couldn't play the arcade machine and I barely knew what the hell was going on in lectures lmao

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

That I had every single one of my journals blank and forgotten at midnight on a Sunday night teehee oopsies

- What are you struggling with?

Remembering I have journals, apparently.

- What would you count as a victory?

Gonna go get my duck tomorrow after all this API shit finally clicked right before the checkpoint and I coded like a DEMON.
