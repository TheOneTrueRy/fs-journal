## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

- If I make a plan before starting to write the code AT ALL it can help a lot with preventing me from spiraling in my own thoughts and getting crushed with an overwhelming weight of where to even begin.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

- I ask my peers, ask my teachers, ask my rubber duck, ask myself, and if all else fails: ask Google :) Not so I can just copy paste some working code okay I JUST WANNA KNOW WHY SOMETHING WORKS OR DOESN'T

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- I think the problems I have the most and that are touched on in this article are that I don't take enough breaks from my code (I have ADHD alright I hyperfixate easy) AND that I can end up thinking through like alllll the code in my mind all at once right in the beginning and overwhelm myself and find it hard to even begin or DO the things that I know I can do and work in my mind.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I guess if I wanted the rest of the assignment to function and have everything totally working/all good then I should've specifically told Payton to do it instead of being subtle and him not doing it at all lmao. Only took me like 10 minutes to do it all so no biggie.
