## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

- Scope basically means where variables are available for use. If something is set outside of a function block or anything that like, and is instead just in the open js, then it is globally scoped and can be used anywhere inside any function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

- Hoisting is when a variable declaration, so a let, const, or var, is "hoisted" to the top of its scope level so it counts and is usable before code is executed.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

- I would honestly not use var in general since it's just a worse and deprecated let. Let is *const*antly used (hehe) and const is specifically if you want a variable that can not possibly be updated or re-assigned.
