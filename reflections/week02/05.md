# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Thursday and Friday were awesome! I love working with a partner, and I absolutely SMASHED my checkpoint within just a couple hours of being let out of lecture on Friday.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
Getting Moon-Miner to save information to localStore like I wanted did not go how I was imagining and the code I tried and thought would work: Totally exploded and didn't work and kicked my fucking ass! I'm gonna get help with doing that from a TA come Monday :)
- What are you struggling with?
Overwhelming myself with self-pressures, intrusive thoughts, and overthinking all the code I could possibly write immediately upon giving an assignment instead of planning in smaller-goals. At least I *WAS* really struggling with all of that the first three days but I got way better already by Thursday.
- What would you count as a victory?
My Moon-Miner checkpoint being so fucking awesome :)
