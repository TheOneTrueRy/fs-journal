## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- "Function Declaration" is the way that is usually used and seems best when writing a function, "Function Expressions" are another how you define a named or anonymous function, and "Arrow Function Expression" is just a shorter syntax way to do a Function Expression. Function Expressions and Arrow Function Expressions are not hoisted so they can not be used before they are declared (so they suck honestly)

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- A function has *parameters* in it's parenthesis when it is being written or declared, what is put into those parenthesis when the function is being CALLED or invoked is *arguments*

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- Higher order function are functions that accept another function as it's parameter or argument. One I've used several times now already is SetInterval

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- I thought up and used a good idea of having a container padded within a container-fluid, and then bordering the container so it had like an inline border inside the container-fluid box. That looked nice.
