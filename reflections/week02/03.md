## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- You can write things directly into the console using the developer tools or you can use code methods such as console.log() or console.error() to print specific information or errors into the console whenever something happens.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The elements tab allows you to see all of your HTML/CSS. You can change things in this information just on the fly and have it show up on the page, a fast way to try quick-fixes to any problem you may be having and not have them be lasting.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- Debugging tools such as break points and the JavaScript Debugging pane with in the Sources tab can help greatly in debugging code.
