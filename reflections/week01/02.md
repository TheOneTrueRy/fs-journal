## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
- Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Selectors are the things are :'s in CSS selectors or classes. Such as a tag:hover, element:hover, maybe some link based ones such as :visited. As you may be able to tell, the one I can see myself using the most is hover :)

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
- Specificity determines in what order style attributes are applied to your element. You can then make it so whatever has a certain CLASS style is different than other similar elements that are only being affected by an ELEMENT style.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
- Completely un-questionable dominating rule throws chaos into the otherwise understandable specificity system.
