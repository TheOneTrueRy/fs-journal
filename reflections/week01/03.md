## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
- Adding color highlights to items either in the form of coloring the text or background itself or what I really liked, the colored border on one side of it.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
- Bootstrap comes with btn,bg,text, etc. color classes based on what kind of content that color would be best used on. Primary, Secondary, Success, Danger, Warning, Info, and Light.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
- Good Design can influence what people see as a good or positive action/button and what they see a bad/negative/destructive action/button. Also could use enticing colors to draw attention to what you want such as a BUY button, and take attention away from things you don't want attention being put on such as some cheeky small legal text.
