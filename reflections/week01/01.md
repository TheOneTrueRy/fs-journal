## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

- Git allows us to keep a "database" of all the versions of the code in our projects, and allows us to archive/access past saves.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

- Multiple Branches allows for different people to be working on a project and not all manipulating and pushing/pulling to and from the Main branch of the code.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

- Git is the local tool on your PC used to save and archive versions/commitments, while GitHub is a remote server where we host those versions, commitments, and code online.
