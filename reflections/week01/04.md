## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
- To get an idea of how you want a site you plan on building to look.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
- There are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity wireframes. Each one has their purpose of doing as much work as really is needed. Example would be how if you're in the beginning of talks with a client or beginning of a personal idea you can just make a quick "low-fidelity"sketch/outline of a site.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
- Yeah, I think that the inspiration and visual realization it can provide are both very worth it, and that's not even counting the worth it has towards providing a mock of a potential product for a client.
