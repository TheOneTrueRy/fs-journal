# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
Honestly I think everything went pretty well this week. I had a really enjoyable time and this is already getting pretty exciting :D
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
You *really* should link your own personal css stylesheet AFTER/UNDER the bootstrap link, so YOU are in charge instead of that stinky bootstrap (love you bootstrap)
- What are you struggling with?
My skills in shooters at home are suffering from how much time I now am doing school instead of playing them :(
- What would you count as a victory?
I posted my first bootstrap clone site to everyone in the slack and lots of people were like WHOA good job man it's amazing and came up to me in school asking how I did so well :P
