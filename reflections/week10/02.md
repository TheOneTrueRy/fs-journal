## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

- A list is basically an array, when you are asking to get back a List<Object> you are saying you expect an array of (Object)s back.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

- Probably all the list versions of the usual array methods we constantly used, like Add, Remove, Find, FindAll, Contains, Sort, etc.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

- Can still use bracket notation to target the index of a list and grab an object that way, like say Object item = list[1] grabs the first Object out of the List (named list)
