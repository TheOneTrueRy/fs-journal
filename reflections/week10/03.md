## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- Columns are the set keys, rows are objects that fill out each of those columns with a value.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- I'm gonna try and use those back tick things as an answer box here I don't actually know how they (these journals) work but alright
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(2000) NOT NULL
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';
```

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- DELETE FROM will delete a row or rows from a table while DROP TABLE drops/deletes the entire table itself.
