## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

- There is the value type, which is a data type where the variable directly carries it's own value, the reference type where it is just storing the address of the location of the data rather than the data/value itself, like strings or arrays, and finally the pointer type which... is just absolute nonsense. That's it's difference from the others, the fact that the article could not even come close to making me understand what it is like the other two lmao.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

- The value type data types are alllll the number ones, booleans, and some other misc ones but the main difference here is yeah you can't just call something a number or even just some random "let variable =" and then whatever number value you could possibly want. You have int for whole numbers, decimal for numbers with decimals on them, double i think is specifically two decimal points? BIGINT and smallint are... things... yeah its uhhhh its a little more complicated than JavaScript there!

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

- Well reference types are when data for a variable, like a string, are technically being stored some other random place in the memory, and that "reference type" is just a pointer to the location of wherever that data is actually being stored.
