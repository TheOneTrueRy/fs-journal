## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

- Enums as I knew them were basically establishing values where those were the only acceptable data values if someone were to make an object containing an enum. Like a JS enum was like ['bing', 'bong'] and then if someone tries to push an object with the enum key having a value of anything other than exactly bing or bong it was wrong, providing limited selectable choices basically.

- When it comes to C#: Oh my god! I don't even know! And I don't think that with this journal article I could possibly even know! Please God actually teach or explain this in school at some point in an actual sensible and English way I want to use enums I miss them ðŸ˜­

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- You can just put an = in the "options" of it and assign a different value to one of the options than it has be default, like changing an enum from it's 3 named values being a default of 0, 1, and 2 behind the scenes to changing the first to 1 with "Low = 1", thus making the other 2 become 2 and 3.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- I mean I used plenty of enums for things in JavaScript, but I had absolutely no clue how to use enums in C# to use them in the newer labs, and when I asked Mick and Savannah they were like ehhhhh maybe don't lol. I wanted to make topping options for my CSharpBurgerShack :(

- I ammmm strugglingggg with uhhhhhhkjhkfgfgshlkmfsgh actually putting in the right amount of effort and time on this assignment I'm not gonna lie, but it's the weekend so I'm going to keep telling myself that I'm going to lock in when I'm back in school and this is literally the only thing I have to work on.
