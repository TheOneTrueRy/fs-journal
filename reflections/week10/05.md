# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Well learning C#, or at least what they taught us of it so far, hasn't been too bad and makes enough sense to me, so that's been going pretty well yeah.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

The extreme amount of security problems in Gratuities (our capstone) that Mick used and manipulated the moment we got our site live and Jonah posted the link in the slack of the whole class lmao.

- What are you struggling with?

uhhhhh I don't know, my stomach hurts right now so I guess that's a pretty serious struggle

- What would you count as a victory?

Mick's infiltration of Gratuities and other feedback received when we made it live allowed me to go in and make our site much more secure, user friendly, and polished before we have to present it to any of our other peers, juniors, employers, etc. üòÅ I actually appreciated him messing with us a lot lol
