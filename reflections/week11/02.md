## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

- A primary key is the main identifier column of that table, and serves as the primary property of each item in that table. A foreign key is kind of like a virtual, it references a column/property on another table, like how if you have a creatorId on your table of items, a foreign key would be written like so: FOREIGN KEY (creatorId) REFERENCES accounts(id).

2. What is an `Alias`?

- When you represent any table, like through a WHERE, JOIN, or FROM you can type a little alias right to the right of the table name to basically say what each item in that table would be called, like FROM keeps keep or JOIN accounts acct.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

- This really doesn't make sense with having two different tables named doctors but alright. I would say SELECT docs.*, patient.* FROM doctors(2) JOIN patients patient ON patient.doctorId = docs.doctorId WHERE docs.doctorId = @doctorID
