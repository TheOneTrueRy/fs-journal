## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

- Honestly, this course has been great. I've enjoyed what I've learned and actually have a lot of fun and passion for coding, My classmates have been a blast to meet and hang out with, and the staff have been really great to have on my side. I'm going to work hard on this final, get that final duck (final 2 ducks really), and either go find a job for some random company to start down my Software Dev career path or become a TA here at CodeWorks if they'll accept me ðŸ˜Š

- I'm not gonna lie to you, I don't remember the details of working on this assignment for any specific day. I don't remember things by what day they happened! Ah! It was a fun assignment though that looks pretty good and is almost "perfect" (enough)
