## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

- SQL Injection is the "injection" of arbitrary SQL into a web app's database query that uses SQL, it's a way for attackers to take control of the database in a way that they really shouldn't, such as using DROP TABLE to delete an entire table of data.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

- User input through some type of form, like a search bar, the modification of cookies that the web app processes data from, and forged HTTP Headers.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

- This article really just says over and over to just use some kind of tester or third party thing to detect if your system or SQL is vulnerable to SQLi, and keeps saying over and over to just... sanitize your user inputs and SQL methods. What does that actually specifically mean or what to do? Idk :)
