## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

- It allows for one class to inherit the properties and methods (other than some explained below) of another class to use, so we can section off certain parts, like how we make Profiles for Accounts to section off emails so they aren't provided in the data given to users.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

- All members are inherited by the child class from the parent class other than constructors and finalizers.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

- Child classes can't access members of the parent class that are under the protection level of private instead of public or internal.
