# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I enjoyed working on All-Spice and I think that I have a pretty good understanding of how to properly use C# and SQL for a backend/database. The lectures were enjoyable and work as great references for my work on the final/other C# projects! :D

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

Uhhhhh I really don't remember anything that shocking or surprising. Maybe that donating plasma gets you so much money? (Andrew does it) (And now as of today, Sunday, so do IIIIIIII)

- What are you struggling with?

Just some minor things, like how the blue border around a focused searchbar input wont go away no matter what CSS I put on it, I don't remember how to force user inputs in a form to be like ToUppercase or lowercase or whatever to make searching better, and I still would like more done on Gratuities. Aiya...

- What would you count as a victory?

I suddenly got some sick spin types/tricks down on ping pong
