## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- Restrict dumb or malicious users from messing with your code that you want private!

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

- The underscore prefix before actually we could encapsulate things and make them private showed the *intention* of a method/function being "private" and that you didn't want the user to use it directly, but they still could anyways if they wanted. Closures... look like nonsense and aren't actually talked about in this reading in the slightest soooo screw em :)

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

- I believe we just make the variable/function outside the exported class somewhere else in the js file. This allows us to have access to running and using the function or variable but restrict the user from manipulating it directly.
