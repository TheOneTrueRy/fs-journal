> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

- You may need to update parts of a page in response to certain events, such a user input in something like a textarea. That can a lot of pushing and pulling in code and difficulty in keeping everything in sync. *That* is the problem the Observer Pattern seeks to solve.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

- The subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method. (Am I supposed to put the overarching "Event Observer" here)

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

- You want me to go just randomly look into the chaos of the vast bcw-template and figure out what I'm even supposed to figure out for the sake of this prompt? While it's 1 am on a Sunday night? I really think not.
