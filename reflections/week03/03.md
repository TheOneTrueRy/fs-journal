## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

- Get and Set.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

- Make sure to return the obj[prop] as well

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

- Can be used to make it so you get back specific, labeled info back when you do something along with possibly making specific conditions give errors instead of data (to protect yourself/data from the user)
