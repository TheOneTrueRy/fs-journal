## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

- Having multiple script tags slowing down html, restricting malicious (or dumb) users, organizing code in the MVCS format, etc.

2. How does export differ from export default?

- Export default is specifically exporting the default values of the things you list after it.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

- You can have multiple modules/script files all in the end being funnel'd towards one that is actually drawing to the page or being used by the page, so you don't need multiple script tags and you can have page manipulation code locked off from the user in helpful ways.
