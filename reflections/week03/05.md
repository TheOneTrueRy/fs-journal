# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Basically everything past Monday, the week went real well and I've gotten MCVS down and am still feeling very good and naturally attuned to JavaScript.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?

uhh idk Nothing?

- What are you struggling with?

Installing and properly importing or using external modules like the fucking timeago.js I hate that shit so much why will it not just work and why does no one online give any kind of actual detailed guide or description as if no one is learning how to code and use VSCode or JS these days ffs

- What would you count as a victory?

I got much better at Clone Hero after playing it for 2 straight hours on Friday after getting out of lecture lol
