# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Inheritance is a concept that is part of "Object Orient Programming" (OOP). It is all about the making of reusable code that you can, well, reuse üòÖ. It helps greatly in preventing rewriting the same code over and over. It also can be seen as the ability of one object to acquire (inherit) the properties of another object.
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Singleton design pattern is a design pattern where if a class is made to that pattern it will only have a single instance of it, other classes will be unable to create instances of it, and will have to access it through its single, global access point.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Observer design pattern involves too different objects, an observer and a subject. If there is any change made to the state of the subject, the observer(s) watching that subject is notified.
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Strategy design pattern involves different solution methods and a range of algorithms distinct from the program and autonomous. I believe UML is a type of/user of the Strategy design pattern. It also includes the special attribute of being able to have its variables or code changed at runtime.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
You have an overarching big class with little sub-classes and the client gives instructions on what they want built and the factory decides what sub-class to use or whatever to build what the client wants. It's mainly about hiding the creation logic and stuff from the user. That's about what I could gather from all the nonsense articles I read online ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (That goes for every one of these design pattern answers)
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Test driven development seems to be a way of going little bit by little bit in coding, writing a unit test that your feature or function needs to pass, writing just enough code (the simplest possible) for it to pass, and then refactoring it to be all good and however it needs to be, conforming to the rest of your code. You then move onto the next unit test accumulating them allll up.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The "Definition of Done" or DoD is what the developer or team has agreed on to consider totally and properly "done" on a piece of the project's backlog/work.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
As a business owner, I want to be able to hire and fire users onto my business page.
As a user, I want to be able to accept or decline the hiring onto a business page by a business owner.
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
During the Sprint Planning Ceremony the Scrum Master uses the *Product* backlog to create the *Sprint* backlog.
```
**10.** In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I'm gonna go wiiiith it can happen in the daily scrum and the sprint review.
